# SILBERBLICK
SILBERBLICK is a brandname I use to promote my work as photographer.
This project migrates the website from Adobe Portfolio to a more customer and SEO friendly website using the Astro Framework and the masonry library.  
## Scope

The site will provide different pages:  
- landing page with a filterable view
  - single pages for each image with copy
  - Teaser text 
- contact page with email form
- about page
  -  bio of me, the photographer
  -  extension of the teaser text
- functional pages
  -  bookings
  -  ArtShop   
 
## Milestones
1. replicate the layout and content from Adobe Portfolio into Astro.  
2. integrate google calendar via API for bookings
3. integrate ArtShop

## Technical Requirements
- content is generated from markdown files in a folder
- use minimal frameworks and libraries
