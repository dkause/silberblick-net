# SILBERBLICK
SILBERBLICK is a brandname I use to promote my work as photographer.
This project migrates the website from Adobe Portfolio to a more customer and SEO friendly website showcasing my developer skills.  
Google Lighthouse Snapshots indicate a very poor performance of the images. Increasing the performance of the images is the metric for project sucess.

## Scope

### First Milestone
The site will provide different pages:  
- landing page with a filterable view
  - single pages for each image with copy
  - Teaser text 
- contact page with email form
- about page
  -  bio of me, the photographer
  -  extension of the teaser text

### Second Milestone
  -  bookings 
  -  ArtShop   
 
## Milestones
1. replicate the layout and content from Adobe Portfolio into Astro.
    - compare lighthouse metrics before an after
3. integrate google calendar via API for bookings
4. integrate ArtShop

## Technical Requirements
- content is generated from markdown 
- use Astro.js and masonry.js with isotope
- use pico.css
